# 🚀 **The Visionaries — Real-Time Crowd & Airport Screen Intelligence**

### *LabLab.ai Genesis Hackathon*

The Visionaries is a lightweight, production-ready FastAPI backend powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash (Multimodal Vision)**.
It analyzes **images from airports, public spaces, and events** to provide:

### 🔍 **Key Capabilities**

* **Crowd Detection:**
  Identifies how many people are present (low / moderate / high density).

* **Airport Screen Understanding:**
  If the image contains a **departure/arrival screen**, it extracts:
  ✓ Flight Number
  ✓ Departure / Arrival Time
  ✓ Gate
  ✓ Status (On time / Delayed / Boarding)

* **General Vision Intelligence:**
  If the image contains something else, it explains the scene clearly.

This makes it ideal for **smart airports**, **safety monitoring**, **crowd analytics**, or **real-time operations dashboards**.
